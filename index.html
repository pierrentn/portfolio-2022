              Hey ! I'm Pierre Nottin, an interactive developer based in Paris,
              currently studying at Gobelins. I like to experiment with new
              things, especially with webgl and 3D, to create cool stuff. I try
              to challenge myself everyday to keep learning and improve my
              skills. I'm looking for a two years apprenticeship job for my
              master's degree.
            </p>

                  <p>
                    This project was realized during a workshop in partnership
                    with the Orsay Museum. We wanted to create an immersive
                    educational experience during which the user is invited to
                    discover the "art nouveau" and the creation of a perfume
                    bottle.

                    This website was made for french production company when I
                    was working at Ensemble. I mainly worked on the desktop and
                    mobile gallery, plus few other animations. Before it, I
                    spent a lot of time prototyping, to achieve the effect we
                    wanted to do.
